blueprint:
  name: Homematic - 2 button remotes
  description: |
    When a button is pressed, the defined actions will be executed.
    Please keep in mind, that long-press actions might be executed multiple times,
    according to the configured minimum duration for long press.
    This can be configured in the CCU.
    Use long release to execute an long press action only once the button is released.
